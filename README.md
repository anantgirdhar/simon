# simon (SIMulation MONitor)

This utility provides a framework for automating some of the very repetitive
tasks that I needed to perform while running my OpenFOAM simulations. I have
been running my simulations on PACE at Georgia Tech and there is a file count
quota which I was constantly exceeding so I decided to write something that
would help me keep that in check so that I didn't have to stay on top of it
myself.
